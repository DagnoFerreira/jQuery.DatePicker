jQuery DatePicker
=================

An awesome, lightweight and customizable calendar!

##Installing

Download the required CSS and JS files, add them to your HTML file and you're done.

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/jquery.datepicker.css">
	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.datepicker.js"></script>


##Basic usage

###Automatic mode

Create an input, and add the `data-select="datepicker"` data attribute.

If you want to have a toggle button next to the input, wrap both elements into a common container and add the `data-toggle="datepicker"` data attribute to the button.

**HTML**

	<div class="input-group">
		<input type="text" class="form-control" name="date" id="date" data-select="datepicker">
		<span class="input-group-btn"><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="datepicker"><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i></button></span>
	</div>

###Requirements

 - jQuery 1.8+
 - A recent/decent web browser (Firefox, Chrome or Opera suggested; IE8+ works too)
 - A valid HTML 5 DOCTYPE (strongly recommended)

###Contributing

Fork the repo, add an interesting feature or fix a bug and send a pull request.

###Troubleshooting

The calendar works on almost every browser BUT it will visually break on IE7 and older (due to buggy CSS support). This is not a concern and will not be fixed.
